                            Problem Code: LAZYCHF
Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in x units of time, 
he finishes it in mâˆ—x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, 
so he delays the work by at max d units of time. 
Given x,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.

________Input:_________
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x,m,d.

________Output:________
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.
